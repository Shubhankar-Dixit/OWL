I'll help you understand how to create documentation similar to the USACO guide with a clean, smooth UI that's easy to navigate. The example you've shared uses MDX (Markdown with JSX) to create an interactive and well-structured documentation site.

Here's how you can build something similar:

## Setting Up a Documentation Site Like USACO Guide

### 1. Choose a Framework

The USACO guide appears to be built with:
- React as the frontend framework
- MDX for content (Markdown with React components)
- A static site generator (likely Next.js, Gatsby, or Docusaurus)

Docusaurus is especially well-suited for documentation sites like this, as it's purpose-built for technical documentation.

### 2. Core Components to Implement

Based on the example, you'll want to create:

- **Interactive Problem Components** (`<FocusProblem>`, `<Problems>`)
- **Disclosure Components** (`<Spoiler>`)
- **Language Section Tabs** (`<LanguageSection>`, `<CPPSection>`, etc.)
- **Interactive Quizzes** (`<Quiz>`)

### 3. Implementation Steps

Now, let's create some custom React components that will help you achieve the interactive elements seen in the USACO guide, I AM USING VITE SO IF POSSIBLE IMPLEMENT IT THERE SOMEHOW:

Now, let's set up an example MDX document that demonstrates how to use these components:

Let's also create a custom theme and some styles to make the documentation look polished:



Finally, let's put together a README with step-by-step instructions on how to set up this documentation site:
